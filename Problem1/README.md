# Fixed-Width File Parser

This repository contains a Python solution for parsing fixed-width files and converting them into a delimited format like CSV. The parser does not rely on external libraries like `pandas` and is implemented using Python's standard libraries.

## Project Structure

```plaintext
/Data-Engineering-Coding-Challenges
│
├── src/
│   ├── parse_fixed_width_line.py     # Function to parse individual fixed-width lines
│   ├── write_to_csv.py               # Function to write parsed lines to a CSV file
│   ├── parse_fixed_width_file.py     # Combines the above functions to process an entire file
│   └── main.py                       # Main script to execute the parsing process
├── employees.txt                     # Example input fixed-width file
└── employees.csv                     # Output CSV file generated by the script (after running the main script)
```

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imro16/Data-Engineering-Coding-Challenges.git
cd Data-Engineering-Coding-Challenges
```

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

Ensure you have Python installed. This project uses Python’s standard libraries, so no additional dependencies are required.

### 3. Modify the Input File

Place your fixed-width file in the root directory. You can modify the existing `employees.txt` or create a new one.

### 4. Adjust the Field Length Specification

In `main.py`, adjust the `field_lengths` variable to match the lengths of the fields in your fixed-width file. For example:

```python
field_lengths = [5, 10, 10, 8, 4]  # Adjust these lengths as needed
```

### 5. Run the Parser

Execute the following command to parse the fixed-width file and generate a CSV:

```bash
python Problem1/main.py
```

The script will read the input file (`employees.txt` by default), parse it according to the specified field lengths, and output a CSV file (`employees.csv`).

### 6. Check the Output

The generated CSV file will be in the same directory as your input file.

## Example

### Input (`employees.txt`):

```plaintext
101   Alice     Manager   1200002024
102   Bob       Engineer  950002023
103   Charlie   Analyst   750002024
104   Diana     HR        850002022
```

### Output (`employees.csv`):

```plaintext
101,Alice,Manager,120000,2024
102,Bob,Engineer,95000,2023
103,Charlie,Analyst,75000,2024
104,Diana,HR,85000,2022
```
